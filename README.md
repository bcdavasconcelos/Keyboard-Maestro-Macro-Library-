# Welcome to My Keyboard Maestro Macro Library
Right now you'll find macros for working with [DEVONthink 3](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/mykmmlibrary/tree/master/DT3), for using [Pandoc and Multimarkdown](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/mykmmlibrary/tree/master/Pandoc%20and%20MMD) and for searching both the [TLG and LOEB Classical Library](https://github.com/bcdavasconcelos/mykmmlibrary/tree/master/Thesaurus%20Linguae%20Graecae%20(TLG)%20and%20LOEB%20Classical%20Library#tlg--loeb-macros).

I hope they will be useful to you.

Enjoy.
