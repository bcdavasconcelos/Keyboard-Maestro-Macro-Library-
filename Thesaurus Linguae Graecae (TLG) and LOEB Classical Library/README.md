# TLG & Loeb Macros

Both macros use data collected by @fractaledmind ([Stephen Margheim](https://github.com/fractaledmind/Classical-Studies-Resources)) in JSON format, with modifications, to populate the awesome *Spotlight Search Prompt* Macro by @dagware ([Dan Thomas](https://github.com/dagware/DanThomas/blob/master/Keyboard%20Maestro%20Macros%2C%20Plugins%20and%20Videos.md)). The result is a practical shortcut to lookup any ancient author on [TLG Online](http://www.tlg.uci.edu) and on the [LOEB Classical Library](https://www.loebclassics.com). 

The TLG Macro also relied on Regex Macros shared on the Keyboard Maestro Forum by [JMichaelTX](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/u/jmichaeltx/summary).
